"""The listing row behind an Item, so enrichment can start from the Item itself.

Everything in this app is keyed on the seller SKU, i.e. on an Amazon Product Listing:
``handlers.get_listing`` throws without one, ``get_product`` reads strictly from the
listing and never from the Item behind it, and ``save_listing`` refuses to write an
enrichment for a sku that has no listing. So "enrich this Item" has to mean "enrich
the Item's listing", and an Item with no listing yet needs one before a run can start.

This module is the ONLY place a listing row is created without SP-API. It is local:
nothing is sent to Amazon, and the row it writes says so —

  • ``listing_status = "incomplete"``, never the doctype default ``"pending"``.
    ``pending`` means "a push Amazon has not confirmed yet", and the connector's
    reconcile deliberately SKIPS such rows (spapi/reconcile.py) so it cannot stamp
    on an in-flight write. A locally created row left at the default would be
    invisible to every reconcile, forever.
  • ``last_synced_at`` and ``catalog_synced_at`` stay empty. They would lie about a
    row that has never touched Amazon, and their emptiness is already the honest
    "this came from the Item, not from Amazon" signal — so no marker field is needed.

The other invariant is that an EXISTING listing is never edited here. Amazon's own
title, description, price and photos beat anything the Item can offer, and an
enrichment that quietly overwrote them would lose real data every time someone
pressed the button. So a resolved listing is returned untouched and `created` is
False; the single exception is a row that is already NAMED after the item but has no
`product` link, where that one field is filled so the Item form can find it next time.

This now lives in the app that owns Amazon Product Listing, so the DocType is always
present and the old "is the connector installed" guard is a tautology. It is kept
anyway: it costs one `db.exists` and it is what turns a half-migrated bench into a
sentence rather than a MissingDoctypeError.

def listing_values_from_item(item, marketplace=None):
	"""The listing row for one Item, as a plain dict — the whole Item → listing mapping.

	Pure by design: no writes, and the only lookup is the marketplace's currency. That
	keeps the mapping testable on a bench without the connector installed, which is
	where the rules that matter (see below) would otherwise go unchecked.

	`item` is an Item document or any mapping with its fields.

	Two fields are dropped when they carry nothing but the item code. ERPNext defaults
	`item_name` to `item_code`, and routinely stores `description` as a copy of
	`item_name` — its own validation guards on exactly that. Copying either through
	would hand the agent "SKU-00123" as the seller's title and existing copy, and the
	model would try to honour it. An empty field is the honest input: `title_field`
	falls back to the row's name anyway.

	What is deliberately NOT mapped, and why:
	  • price / quantity — `standard_rate` is not an Amazon offer, and a fabricated one
	    would show up in get_product and mislead both the model and the reviewer.
	  • condition / fulfillment_channel — the doctype's defaults are the truthful
	    answer for a listing that is not live.
	  • asin / product_type — only Amazon can say, and the product type is derived from
	    the ENRICHED title at save time anyway (product_type.py).
	  • is_variation_parent / parent_asin / parent_listing / variation_theme — read-only
	    and connector-owned; parentage comes from Amazon, not from an Item template.
	  • bullet_points / keywords / suppression_reasons — the agent writes these to
	    Amazon Enriched Listing. Empty here means "the seller has no copy yet", which
	    is exactly the situation.
	  • brand / item_group / weight — no listing field to hold them, and the agent
	    already reads the far richer variant specs off the Item (handlers.item_variant_specs).
