"""
The four catalog tools: read the product, look at a photo, read the seller's existing
vocabulary, save the result.

Each callable here is referenced by dotted path in agent_meta's tool catalog and
invoked by the Alaiy OS executor's tool loop as ``handler(**tool_input)``. A
handler either:

  • returns JSON-serializable data (dict/list/str/…), which is sent back to the
    model as the tool_result, or
  • returns a dict with a "_content_blocks" key holding ready-made Anthropic
    content blocks — used here so the model can actually *see* the product
    photos (vision), not just read their URLs.

Raising is fine: the executor catches the exception and feeds it back to the
model as an errored tool_result. We still prefer to degrade gracefully (skip an
unreadable image, guard optional rows) so a single bad attachment does not sink
the whole enrichment.

The source of truth read here is the **Amazon Product Listing** DocType (its `name` is the
seller SKU, autoname: field:sku), NOT the Item — the listing's own fields (title,
description, bullets, keywords, offer data) and its `images` child table are all we
look at. The agent does not edit the listing (or the Item behind it) and does not
submit anything to Amazon — that is the admin approval / connector step.

save_listing persists the finished enrichment into the Amazon Enriched Listing
DocType in "Needs Review" status, for the admin to edit and approve.

# is resolved here next to the rest of the listing reads rather than inside the image
# tool.
#
# Where the variant's own photo comes from, in order:
#
#   1. `skuImage` on the linked Item's variant specs. This is the authoritative

#      (`ng_specs_json`) owned by the customer app that ingests it, so it is read
#      defensively — a bench without that app simply falls through.
#   2. This listing's own row flagged `is_main`.
#   3. The first family photo — a fallback that IS logged and reported, because it
#      means the shopper sees a generic image where they should have seen theirs.
#
# "The family" is the parent listing, which the connector models natively:
# `parent_listing` links a child to its variation parent (`is_variation_parent`), and
# `variation_theme` says what the family varies by. So the gallery is the PARENT's
# images when there is a parent, and the listing's own when there is not — which is
